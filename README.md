# Metabolic Modeling Tutorials

This repository contains a few tutorials on metabolic modeling. To run the examples please follow the installation instructions first.

### Installation

To run these tutorials you need a Python 3.6 environment. If you don't have one already, you can install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Then you need to install [ReFramed](http://reframed.readthedocs.io) and a few other packages.

```
pip install reframed escher cplex matplotlib mewpy
```

Please note that this will install the free version of [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer), which is limited to the simulation of small models. To install the full version you should obtain an academic license.

### Running the examples

Just start jupyter from a terminal and you will be able to run the exercises in your browser.

```
jupyter notebook
```
